# ULMFiT_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

Notebook submitted to a Fellowship.ai Challenge in 2019 September.

Using Kaggel dataset from US Airline Customer Service's Twitter, trained a model to predict the sentiment of the tweets (negative, neutral, postive) with 85% accuracy.

I've used the fast.ai library, and transfer learning to fine-tuned a pre-trained langauge model for the sentiment classification problem.

Using:
- pytorch, fast.ai library
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
